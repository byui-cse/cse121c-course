	<h1>Organization and Access</h1>
	<p>All computer languages are ways to organize your communication and thinking. In this, they are very
	similar to spoken languages. Each spoken language, or family of spoken languages, does this organization
	differently. English sentences often have a structure of Subject-Helper Verb-Verb-Predicate...The boy will bite the dog, for example.
	German, a language closely related to English, organizes things differently. Sometimes German sentences have a
        Subject-Helper Verb-Predicate-Verb structure...
	Ich werde das Buch bald lesen, which if translated word-by-word is "I will the book soon read." Spanish has adjectives 
	after the nouns they modify.</p>
	<p>While each language has its own organizational rules, they all do the same thing. They allow us to organize and express
	our thinking.</p>
	<h3>Functions - the fundimental organization concept of C</h3>
	<p>C, and its descendent language Python, have functions as a fundamental organizational structure. When you truly begin 
	thinking in C, you will be thinking in functions. You will think of how functions are related to each other. You will 
	have thoughts along these lines, "If this function calls that one..." You will be able to do this since you will eventually
	realize that when you are designing solutions in C, how a function accomplishes something is not as important as that it will, 
	and that you can wait to figure out how to complete the function later.</p>
	
	<p>Put an example here of desinging a solution thinking in functions.</p>
	
	<h2>A Function in C</h2>
	<p>Since Python is a descendent of C, there are similarities and differences between the languages regarding how you declare 
	functions. All C function declarations follow the pattern you can see here.</p>
	<p><span class="blue">returnType</span> theFunctionName(<span class="green">parameters</span>)</p>
	<p>In C, you are required, as part of the function declaration, to declare the return type. In other words, 
	the type of the thing being returned. If your function will return an integer, the return type is 'int'. 
	If it will return a double, the return type is 'double'. Also, a function in C can only return one type of thing. 
	You cant have it sometimes return a string and other times return an int.</p>
	<p>Another item you must understand is that , C uses '{' and '}' for scope operators instead of the 
	indentation you may be used to. The multiply function, below, shows how these work.</p>
	<p><pre>
<code>int multiply(int aMultiplicand, int aMultiplier){
	return aMultiplicand * aMultiplier;
}</code>
</pre></p>
	<p>The body of the multiply function, the stuff it is supposed to do, or any other C function goes between 
	the begin scope operator, '{', and the end scope operator, '}'. These operators allow you to have multiple 
lines of code in the body of a function. Take a look at the average function below.</p>
<p><pre>
<code>double average(double aNumber, double anotherNumber){
	double sum = aNumber + anotherNumber;
	double average = sum/2.0;
	return average;
}</code>
</pre></p>
	<p>Here, there are three lines of code in the body of the function. Could it be done in one? Of course...
	but should you is the question you should ask. Here is one of many places you can find more information on 
	<a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_functions.htm">C functions</a>.</p>

	<p>Another thing you will notice when you look at code written by professionals, is that each function is often  
	found in two seperate, but related, files. The first is called a header file and has a name like ###.h. 
	The second is the implementation file and has a name like ####.c. The appropriate way to use these files is 
	to declare your function, without a body, in the header file, and implement it and its body in the 
	implementation file. Let's write a few silly math functions using a header file and implementation file.</p>
<h4>The Header File</h4>
<p><pre>
<code>/*
 * sillymath.h
 *
 */


/*
 * declarations of a few silly math functions
 */
#ifndef SILLYMATH_H_
#define SILLYMATH_H_

/*
 * A silly function for adding two integers
 */
int sum(int anAddend, int anotherAddend);

/*
 * A silly function for multiplying two integers
 */
int multiply(int aMultiplicand, int aMultiplier);

/*
 * A silly function for dividing two doubles
 */
double divide(double aDividend, int aDivisor);

/*
 * A silly function for averaging two integers
 */
double average(int aNumber, int anotherNumber);

#endif /* SILLYMATH_H_ */
}</code>
</pre></p>
<h4>The Implementation File</h4>
<p><pre>
<code>/*
 * sillymath.c
 * *
 */


/*
 * implementations of a few silly math functions
 */


/*
 * A silly function for adding two integers
 */
int sum(int anAddend, int anotherAddend){
	return anAddend + anotherAddend;
}

/*
 * A silly function for multiplying two integers
 */
int multiply(int aMultiplicand, int aMultiplier){
	return aMultiplicand * aMultiplier;
}

/*
 * A silly function for dividing two doubles
 */
double divide(double aDividend, double aDivisor){
	return aDividend/aDivisor;
}

/*
 * A silly function for averaging two integers
 */
double average(int aNumber, int anotherNumber){
	return (aNumber + anotherNumber)/2.0;//notice this is 2.0 (the return type)---not 2 (the parameters' type)
}</code>
</pre></p>
<p>With your code split between your header and implementation files, it makes it easy for someone to use your 
code. All they have to do is put both files in their project and put #include "sillymath.h" at the top of their 
code file.</p>

	<p><span class='green'>Heads up::</span>When you try to compile your app, if you get an error similar to this 'ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture x86_64', 
	it is saying that you have declared a function in a header file but forgot to put an implementation for it in 
	an implementation file.</p>
	<p>Earlier, we mentioned how, as you become more experienced, you will begin to think in functions rather than 
	the individual lines of code. Let's rethink a couple of the silly math functions to make them a little less silly.</p>
	<p>Let's start by asking, "What does average mean?" An average is a sum of some set of numbers divided by the count 
	of the numbers in the set. For example, the average of {4,6,7} is (4+6+7)/3. Yes, this is something you've known 
	for a long time. The point is, if you look at the stated definition of average, the statement contains two interesting 
	words, 'sum' and 'divide'. These are two functions. Average, then, can be viewed as the result of a sum function and a divide 
	function being used one after the other. 
	Let's see what average function's implementation would look like if we write it while thinking in functions.</p>
<p><pre>
<code>/*
 * A less-silly, but not great, function for averaging two integers
 */
double less_silly_average(int aNumber, int anotherNumber){
	return divide(sum(aNumber, anotherNumber),2.0);
}</code>
</pre></p>
	<h3>Libraries - sharing your functions with others</h3>
	<p> A higher order organizational idea in C is library. Libraries are a way that you can share your compiled code with other programmers 
		or they can share with you. These libraries consist of compiled groups of functions that, unlike 
		applications, can not run on their own. Instead, you add their library to the project for your application and use their functions 
		in your code.</p>
	<h4>Libraries - structure and compilation</h4>
	<p>You have used others libraries alread without knowing it. Each time you put #include&ltstdio.h&gt or #include &ltstdlib.h&gtin your application you were using 
	a library someone else wrote and compiled for you. Take a look at <a href="https://github.com/kozross/awesome-c">this partial list, by type</a>, 
	of open source libraries people have created for you to use. It will give you an idea of how much you can do in an application 
	without having to write all the code.</p>
	<p>To share your functions, you create one or more header files that declare all of the functions you want them to have access too and 
		write the code for the declarations in those header files...just like we did with the silly math functions. Since, as a C programmer, 
		you will be writing and using libraries, let's step through how to create and use a compiled, static library of those functions. (
	<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/static-vs-dynamic-libraries/">What is a Static Library?</a>) We'll follow the process outlined in 
	<a href="https://youtu.be/TEgVahFr1GA">this video</a>.</p>
	
	<p>Using a library in a project is where all this library business is headed. It isn't particularlly difficult in eclipse, but it is picky. 
	<a href="https://youtu.be/hT3lOd16xrQ"></a>This video</p> steps you through the process of using a library, one of your own or someone 
	else's, in an application you are writing.

	<h3>Pointers - keeping track of where things are</h3>
	<p>Because of when and for what it was created, the PDP-11 computer, the C language has a structure many other languages do not...
	it's called a pointer. A pointer is a way of keeping track of where something is in RAM or in other parts of the machine. 
	Whatever that something is, a pointer will point at it. Don't make it harder than this. This is the entire concept. 
	It just keeps track of where stuff is so you can use it or modify it later. Now let's use pointers to make the divide and 
	less_silly_average functions better than what we've already done.</p>
	
	<p>C functions can only return 1 value. What then do you do when you need two pieces of information back from a function? Pointers 
	come to your rescue! One of problems with the less_silly_divide function that is used by the less_silly_average function is that 
	less_silly_divide will fail if the function is passed a 0 via the divisor parameter. "But that will never happen,right?" Oh...believe 
	me it will. Somebody will call your function after calculating what the divisor should be, and sooner or later it will end up being 
	0. Let's modify less_silly_divide and less_silly_average so we can find out if they succeed or fail. Let's call these new function s 
	better_divide and better_average.</p>

	<p>If you look at the code below, you will find a double variable designed to hold the average being calculated. You will also notice 
	a new parameter being passed, '&amp;theAverage'. The &amp; is the operator in C that produces a pointer. In this case, the pointer 
	points at the double variable 'theAverage'. You'll see how to leverage this a little bit later.</p>
	<p>Also notice the boolean variable, 'succeeded', that is assigned the return value of the better_average function. What is going to 
	happen in the better_average code is this. If everything goes as well, better_average updates the value in the double variable 'theAverage' 
	and returns the boolean value true. If anything goes wrong, the double variable 'theAverage' is not updated and better_average returns 
	false.</p>



<p><pre>
<code>
#include &le;stdbool.h&gt;
.
.
.
int main(void) {
.
.
.
/*
 * Using the better_average function
 */
double theAverage = 0.0;
bool succeeded = better_average(10, 3, &theAverage);
printf("1 is true, 0 is false\n; succeeded = %d with quotient of %f\n",succeeded, theAverage);
</code>
</pre></p>

<p>To make this work, we need a better_divide function to go along with the better_average function. What, then, do these functions 
look like? As you can see, both have a boolean return type, and three parameters...the two from the silly versions of the functions 
and a strange one, 'double* aQuotientPtr' for the divide function and 'double* anAverage' for the average function.</p>

<p><pre>
<code>/*
 * A better, but not great, function for averaging two integers
 */
bool better_divide(double aDividend, double aDivisor, double* aQuotientPtr){
	bool success = false;
	if(aDivisor != 0.0){
		*aQuotientPtr = aDividend/aDivisor;
		success = true;
	}
	return success;
}

/*
 * A better, but not great, function for dividing two integers
 */
bool better_average(int aNumber, int anotherNumber, double* anAverage){
	return better_divide(sum(aNumber,anotherNumber),2.0,anAverage);
}</code>
</pre></p>
<p>If we act as if we were a debugger and trace the call from the main function you saw above all the way 
	through the better_average and better_divide functions, we can see what is happening with the variables 
	and paramters. Here we go.</p>

<p>When better_average gets called, the aNumber parameter is assigned a copy of the integer 10, the anotherNumber parameter is 
assigned a copy of the integer 3, and the anAverage parameter is assigned a copy of the double pointer, theAverage. An important 
point to remember is that since theAverage pointer is a copy of the anAverage pointer, they both point at the same thing.</p>

<p>Due to the order of operations rules, the same ones you learned about in Python, the next thing that happens is the calling of 
	the sum function. It adds copies of aNumber(10) and anotherNumber(3) and returns the result(13). The better_divide function is then 
	called. In the better_divide function, the aDividend parameter is a copy of the sum functions result(13), aDivisor is a copy of the double 2.0, and 
	aQuotient is a copy of the anAverage pointer.</p>

<p>There are two main things that have to happen in the better_divide function. One of which is to check to make sure we aren't 
	trying to divide by 0 and return false if we are. The other is to update the double that aQuotientPtr is pointing to with the 
	result of doing the division. Be careful. You don't want to update the pointer itself. When you update a pointer, you change 
	what where it is pointing. No...you want to update the double the pointer is pointing at. To do this you use the 'dereference 
	operator', *. It is the same character as the pointer indicator. Don't let that fool you. This line in better_divide 
	<code>*aQuotientPtr = aDividend/aDivisor;</code> updates the result double variable in the main function. After all, that is 
	what aQuotientPtr is pointing at.</p>
