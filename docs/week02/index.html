	<h1>Similarities and Differences</h1>
	<h3>Shared Operators</h3>
	<p>Remember, Python has C as one of its ancestors. Because of this, it is not shocking to find out that they share many of the same
		operators. These include +, -, /, *, ==, !=, &lt, &gt, etc. By going to these two sites, you can compare 
		<a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_basic_operators.htm">Python's list of operators</a> to 
		<a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_operators.htm">C's list of operators</a>. When you do so, 
		you will find that Python has a few that C does not.</p>
	<h3>C's missing operators</h3>
	<p>Because Python was created after C, its developers were able to add operators they had seen in other languages that made sense, to them, to include
	in Python. These are the ones you should not expect to find in C:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>** - the exponentiation operator</li>
		<li>// - the floor division operator</li>
		<li>&lt&gt - an alternative to !=</li>
		<li>**= - the exponent and assign operator</li>
		<li>and - the logical and operator</li>
		<li>or - the locical or operator</li>
		<li>not - the logical not operator</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Don't get the wrong idea. Each of these behaviors can be done in C, they will just be done a little differently. Take a look
	at Table 1 to see how.</p>

	<h3>Variables</h3>
	<p>In Python, a variable can hold any type of value and can change the type of value it holds. For example, this code is valid in Python.</p>
	<pre>
<code class="Python">age = 3
age = 5
age = 4.2</code>
	</pre>
	<p>C treats its variables differently. In C you not only declare the variable name, but must also declare the type of data the variable can hold.
	This is a valid C variable declaration that can hold an int.</p>
	<pre>
<code>int age = 3;</code>
	</pre>
	While this is valid C code
	<pre>
<code>int age = 3;
age = 5;</code>
	</pre>
	this is not valid.
	<pre>
<code>int age = 3;
age = 4.2;</code>
	</pre>
	<p>As with all things, there are pluses and minuses of requiring the type of a varable to be unchangable. One minus is that you may need to declare 
	more variables. One plus is that there is no chance that the type of data in a variable will change when the code is running. There is a common 
	logic bug in all languages that allow the type of data in variables to change. The programmer forgets that the data type has changed, performs a
	calculation, and then gets strange, unexpected results. This type of logic error can't happen in C since this type of invalid code would fail to compile.</p>
	<h4>Some Common, Valid, C Variable Types</h4>
	<p>Basic Integer Types
	<ul>
		<li>short</li>
		<li>int</li>
		<li>long</li>

	</ul></p>
	<p>Basic Floating Point Types
		<ul>
			<li>float</li>
			<li>double</li>
			<li>long double</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>Boolean Types
		<ul>
			<li>bool</li>
			<li>_Bool</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>Character Types
		<ul>
			<li>char - single character</li>
			<li>char[] - strings of characters</li>
		</ul>

	Be careful. It is tempting to think, "Hey...those doubles look like they could hold bigger integers. Maybe I'll just use them." Such a thought would lead you 
	down a path you do not want to be on. Beginning programmers tend to think of floating point numbers as being a coninuous number line. They are not. There are 
	numbers that a double can not represent. There are gaps in the floating point numbers on all computers in all languages and the larger the integer you 
	try to represent, the higher the probability that adding 1 to that number will result in the original number. This also applies floating point numbers when using 
	variables of type double, not just integers.

	<h3>Manipulating Bits</h3>
	<h4>A Bit Here and a Bit There</h4>
	<p>For some programming jobs, especially those dealing with micro controllers and data compression, manipulating bits can be very important. </p>
	<p>All C ints, longs, shorts, and chars are arrays of bits to the computer. For example, a char is an array of 8 bits. Each bit can have a value of
	1 or 0, on or off. Certain combinations of ons and offs, 1's and 0's, represent each possible char. The character 'A' is 01000001, 'a' is 01100001, and
	'@' is 01000000. You won't need to know the character mappings. This is just to help you understand how your computer deals with characters.
	</p>
	<p>Imagine a situation where you have created a function that had a boolean parameter, set to true or false, that controls how the function behaves.
	Maybe this is a filtering function. Something like filter(int[] nums, bool isEven) that returns all even numbers from the array when isEven is true
	and all the odd numbers when isEven is false. Imagine it's working great. It fits well into the code your boss asked you to write. No bugs...life is good.</p>
	<p>One day your boss comes to you and lets you know that in the next release, this filter function needs to be much more flexible. The customer 
	will be setting options for the filtering and the code needs to handle 8 possible true and false values...and can set more than one to be true and/or false
	at a time. You could write a whole bunch of seperate functions (overloaded functions), each with a different number of boolean parameters. While this would
	work, it would be unwise due to the amount of hours required to test and bug fix all 8 functions. Instead you could write 1 function...if you treat an char 
	as an array of 8 'mini-booleans'. After all, each of the bits in a character is either 0 or 1. You can think of each of these being 1 (true) or 2 (false).</p>
	
	<p>In fact, it you needed to your function could have an int as a paramter providing you with a total of 16 mini-booleans that in the industry are called bit-flags. 
	now your function could look like something like this -- filter(int[] nums, int filteringFlags) -- with if statements to deal with any valid combinations of true and false.</p>

	<p>For the purpose of this class, we'll use char bit-flags rather than int bit-flags to make it easier to learn what is going on.</p>
	<h3>Manipulating Individual Bits</h3><p>Imaging you have a situation where you are using a bit flag and the third bit needs to be 1 (on)....</p>
